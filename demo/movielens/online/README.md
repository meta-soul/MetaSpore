# Online Service for MovieLens Recommender

The overall online engineering framework is developed based on SpringBoot+K8S, and it is also convenient for everyone to deploy to their own servers. We can configure our developing environment according to the installation instructions below. In this demo, our online pipeline consists of several modules such as user modeling, recall, ranking, diversity and summary retrieval, as described in the figure below. When we follow the instructions to finish the last step, an end to end movie recommendation system will be presented completely. If you are Chinese developer, you may like to visit our [CN Doc](README-CN.md).

## 1. Install online-serving components
You need to maven install [online-serving](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/tree/main/java/online-serving) components 
before launching our online recommend service.
1. `MetaSpore Serving` is used to do model inference.
2. `feature-extract` is a maven plugin which generate domains and repositories of MongoDB using its [table yaml files](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/tree/main/demo/movielens/online/src/main/resources/tables). [More information](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/blob/main/java/online-serving/feature-extract/README.md)
3. `experiment-pipeline` is an experiment framework which help us do A/B testing more easily. [More information](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/blob/main/java/online-serving/experiment-pipeline/README.md).
```
cd MetaSpore/java/online-serving
mvn clean install 
```
Then use feature-extract to generate MongoDB related files:
```
cd MetaSpore/demo/movielens/online
mvn com.dmetasoul:feature-extract:1.0-SNAPSHOT:generate
```
Finally, mark directory(target/generated-sources/feature/java) as "Generated Sources Root" if you use IntelliJ IDEA.

## 2. Create application-dev.properties
You need to create resources/**application-dev.properties** from [application-template.properties](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/blob/main/demo/movielens/online/src/main/resources/application-template.properties) and specify:
1. `MongoDB` related configurations. 
2. `MetaSpore Serving` related configurations.
3. `Milvus` related configurations.
4. (Just ignore mysql configurations. We don't use it in this demo but we support multi data sources.)

## 3. Install and configure Consul
You could modify Consul's Key/Value pair to dynamically change the online A/B testing strategies.
1. [Install Consul](https://www.consul.io/downloads) and launch it.
2. Visit Consul's [portal](http://localhost:8500/ui/dc1/kv), and create a new Key/Value pair:
   1. Key is `config/test/scene-config`
   2. Copy this [YAML content](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/blob/main/demo/movielens/online/src/main/resources/experiment.yaml) as value. 
   3. The config file of Consul of our demo is [here](https://github.com/meta-soul/MetaSpore/blob/main/demo/movielens/online/src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml).

## 4. Launch recommend online service
You could run online service entry point (MovielensRecommendApplication.java) and test it now.
For example: `curl http://localhost:8080/user/10` to get recommended movies for user with id 10.
